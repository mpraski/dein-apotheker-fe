    description: I can help you find the right over-the-counter drug for your simple ailments. Please understand that there are a number of situations in which I unfortunately cannot help you. Here are a few simple examples that come to my mind - chronic illnesses, prescription drugs, drugs during pregnancy and lactation and drugs for children. I will be happy to help you with classic cold symptoms such as cough, colds, fever and sore throat or with the following questions.
    items:
    - What helps me against my cough? 
    - What helps me against my cold? 
    - What helps me with my fever? 
    - What helps me with my sore throat?
